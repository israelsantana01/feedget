# 🧠 Idea
This project was designed at Next Level Week (NLW), event promoted by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat). The main idea behind that, is: a simple project who covers the most important things about the techs used. 


<br><br>

# 📋 How does it work?
How we have saw above, this app has a purpose of deal with users feedbacks about anything, or specifically about your system. The user cans select his feedback type, take a screenshot of his screen, because most of erros occurs when the user wants to send a feedback and describe what is happening. After that, a email is sent to the system owner. That's it! A simple idea, but with a lot of things to learn.

### Techs ⚙️
#### [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
#### [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
#### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
#### [Headless ui](https://headlessui.dev/)

<br><br>

# 🔧 Server
The server was build applying SOLID concepts, like: **Dependency Injection** and **Single Responsibility** principles. Also, i am using Prisma to save infos in a database and a mail client to send emails for the system owner when someone send a feedback.
I used [Railway](https://railway.app/) to host the app and the database.
